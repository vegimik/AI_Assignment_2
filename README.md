<h3 align="center">There will be represented a solution for Social Golfers Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Social Golfer Problem (SGP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem. The task is to schedule g √ó p golfers in g groups of p players for w weeks such that no two golfers play in the same group more than once. An instance of the SGP is denoted by the triple g-p-w. It has to be solved by constraint programming.</li>
